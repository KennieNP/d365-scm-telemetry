In this folder, you will find the source code for the PowerBI app report on Dynamics 365 SCM telemetry in Azure Application Insights. 

# Power BI prerequisites
The app is not on appsource yet, so you need to allow it to be installed. 

Go to the PBI admin portal.
Under Tenant settings, Go to Template App settings. Here you can enable template apps that are not listed on app source.
Remember to set the setting back after installing the beta version of the app.

# Getting the report
Use this link to install/update the current development version template app (if you want to test bleeding edge): https://aka.ms/scm-app-beta 

The app comes with sample data.

# Connecting to Azure Application Insights
To connect the app to an Azure Application Insights resource, you need one thing: the Application Insights app id (get it from the API Access menu in the Azure Application Insights portal).

NB! If you get this error "The OAuth authentication method isn't supported for this data source", then please check if the application id is correct. This usually is the root cause for that error.

# Changing parameters after initial configuration
Once you completed the setup of the app, how can you change parameters such as _Application Insights application id_ or _Lookback period_?

You can change configuration settings by going to the Power BI portal, open the workspace for the installed app, go to settings, and then Parameters.

# Sharing the app with coworkers and others
Once installed, it is possible to share the app with coworkers and others (e.g. customers). 

Do this:
1. Share the Power BI workspace with the person. This will make the app appear under _Workspaces_ in their Power BI portal.
2. Provide the url to the person and ask them to open it in a browser. This will make the app appear under _Apps_ in their Power BI portal.
